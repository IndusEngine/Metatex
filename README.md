**Metatex** is a metadata-only texture asset importer for Unity. It
procedurally generates a texture from metadata at import-time.

It provides the following texture generators at the moment:

- Shader/Material baking
- SolidColor
- Linear/radial gradient
- Colormap (Matplotlib colormaps, Turbo, HSVLuv and HSV)
- Checkerboard
- UV checker
- TV test card
